comments on Kofi's group numpy tutorial

1. He has commented his code properly and also provided headings for the syntaxes.
2. He has implemented all the commands and also iused some extra libraray and commands.
3. He explained the broadcasting of numpy arrays in simpler ways but don't have 7 sentences.
He described 5 or more commands in his work which were not present in the tutorial.
Overall, the work was good.
