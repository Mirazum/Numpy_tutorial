# Numpy_tutorial
comments on Kofi's group numpy tutorial

1. He has commented his code properly and also provided headings for the syntaxes.
2. He has implemented all the commands and also iused some extra libraray and commands.
3. He explained the broadcasting of numpy arrays in simpler ways but don't have 7 sentences.
He described 5 or more commands in his work which were not present in the tutorial.
Overall, the work was good.

# Google colab experience
Previously,we used google colab where we could share and do the work together. Later on we decided to do things independently in Ipthon Notebook which was more easier to see outputs and even write the codes.
